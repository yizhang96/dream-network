During the dream, I discussed with Harry the child abuse incident shared to me on WeChat.
I had many dreams about traveling: once in Europe (Spain and France?) travel, once in Brazil (?) with my mom I also planned to spend a few days in several other countries in South America (or Europe) (Portugal/Chile?). Although it didn't work out in the end; once I was in a beach country (Bahamas or Puerto Rico?) with college friends (such as Mr. Liu and others), driving jeeps on the beach and walking on the beach - walking through a castle in the sand and watching the water freeze over as the temperature dropped, and going out to sea in a storm; once in Italy with others, probably the same time dreaming about a lake in Africa with many glass skyscrapers that we visited inside, and many other times dreaming about At the airport (Beijing or New York) getting ready to board, checking passports, following the crowd to find the gate]",1.17-18 1:15AM - 8:30AM

The paper's title was already settled, but I thought I wasn't familiar with its content, so I decided to present on a more familiar paper by Jeff Brooks and Jon Freeman on how emotion concept affects face perception. I started to describe it very smoothly, but then I suddenly got stuck, I was very nervous and wished time could be suspended, so it seemed time was really suspended. So it seemed that time did pause, and I woke up from my dream.",1.21-22 11:45PM - 8:20AM
"Went to an info session of a study abroad institution, asked Mr. Tang and Wang Yue, they also went together. The scene changed to a building, took the elevator to the upper level, in front of which were huge glass floor-to-ceiling windows [like the ones that appeared in the dream before, the top floor lounge where you can eat buffet]. Back on the ground, take the bus home, passing Yuyuantan Park in the middle, I calculated the time according to the navigation, ready to let my mother come to Wukesong subway station to pick me up, but the message was not sent. The one-way fare was eleven yuan, and I was a bit chagrined when I accidentally swiped it twice after getting on the bus. The scene shifted to an indoor space where Harry and I were playing a game that was a bit hard to play, constantly failing and starting over, and I ended up talking to my elementary school classmate (I forget who it was) about it and he made a comment about the game (can't remember the content).",1.22-23 11:20PM - 8:50AM
"I took a test (similar to a college entrance exam), probably in chemistry or biology. At first, I did it quickly and even had the illusion that I could get a perfect score. However, one of the topics was calligraphy, and I sat face to face to write with Gaoteng. He Yuesen was also there. I was so dissatisfied with my writing that I took so much time that I couldn't finish the next question - categorize different items - and I didn't finish it. At the end I seemed to see my score, about 82%, and thought it was okay.
After that, I was doing pull-ups, surrounded by friends and classmates. I did a few of them easily (I felt like I was doing them with assistance) and tried to get my whole upper body up on the bar. The students around me expressed their admiration. Then I played tennis. I couldn't reach a few balls in a row, no matter how I adjusted my posture and stroke time.

The second scene: a trip to Greece with Harry and Tong Hui. Visiting a hall with beautiful carvings and frescoes on the ceiling.

The scene finally shifted from the school to a shopping mall/street - the environment is a bit noisy
The first one is in a mall near the financial street, from a seemingly abandoned door to go in, do a translucent elevator, to the upper floors, and buy clothes; another is in a new Zhongguancun as a model of the place, in the second floor you can eat and Hutchinson or kebabs, and another is in a seaside amusement park or the airport, along the street there are many game halls].",1.30-31 12:40AM - 8:20AM

The person sitting on my right in the class was an Asian girl wearing glasses who spoke Chinese [probably the image came from the Asian girl sitting on the left in the flywheel session a few days ago]. The rest of the audience was almost all white Americans, so I thought, ""This is really different from Columbia University, there are so few Asians here.
The next scene was a ski trip with David S and others. Most of the trails were closed, which was a bit depressing.",
"I dreamed of going to the movies with Mr. Liu and others. I asked Mr. Liu if it was on 34th Street [which movie theater we would go to in reality], and Mr. Liu said no, it was on 14th Street. When we got to the cinema we saw several cases of Coke sitting on the ground next to the ticket office, a bit like that bottle to drink, but thought better of it. At this time a police officer appeared, he pointed to the box office above the large screen said the film shown inside the propaganda film suspected of fraud, he will be watching the film after the official prosecution of it. The movie seems to tell the story of an American family, seemingly a romantic story but actually advertising their brand.
The next scene I was in New York looking at apartments, the very beginning went to the home of a female friend (unknown), her house is on the top floor of an apartment with a great view, but the apartment building is slightly old. Then came to a very old townhouse, climbed several flights of stairs to the door, but finally did not go in. Finally I came to an equity residential apartment building with good facilities and an outdoor lounge on the roof where people were playing billiards. I sat down by the elevator, looking at my swelling dick, suddenly realizing there's something i can get out of it - and finally took out a few leaves, both yellow and green. The swelling suddenly went down, and my heart breathed a sigh of relief.",
"Most of it was still very clear when I woke up in the morning, but I couldn't remember it in the afternoon. I just remembered a scene from a trip in a hot air balloon, thinking that this time I didn't have to fly up to the sky after the sunrise like the one in Turkey [in reality]. As a result, the sky was getting white and we took off only after the sun came out. I was a bit depressed. The balloon flew very fast, and at the edge of a cliff we almost thought we would crash into it, but the pilot was very skilled and we quickly rose to avoid the cliff.
There was also a scene where we attended the new year's drinking salon book club event, Ling Yun was also there, but compared to his usual slightly serious image, he was very enthusiastic when attending the event. At the beginning, we all sat at our own tables, and each group sent one person to get a book from the box at the back of the classroom. Our book was Plato's phaedo, in Chinese. We also saw a few other books, but I forget what they were called.
[About the books-think of museums; once in a dimly lit hall with lots of armor resembling ancient Egyptian and medieval. As a result, I heard that one was stolen, so everyone was evacuated out afterwards; another time was in the United States, a three-story museum with a clear glass composition, like a moma, with a lot of modern artworks inside; and another time was in a castle in a very large desert, very exotic. I wore around at the top seemed to be looking for someone. Another time, it seemed to be the met, and it seemed to be the Louvre, or maybe the British Museum, which was full of tourists, and I was weaving through the crowds, with paintings and sculptures hanging in the corridors. Another time was at a car show, which was very crowded and seemed to be with a class. A few times I nearly got lost with the crowd and finally it seemed like someone was going to get in a car and just leave.]",
"I dreamt of chatting with Kevin about how I was going to spsp and then talking about social network study. he corrected me on my understanding of a concept. Then I wanted to continue the conversation, but he politely asked me to leave his office.
In the next scene, I dreamed of an event with Mr. Tang and Mr. Liu, which was conducted by car. While walking in the garage, I heard that Mr. Tang's baby was born. So looking into the distance, I saw a baby, and Mr. Tang said he named him Tang Chen.",

The second scene, lying in bed with Maoxinyi. She asked me if I had ever chased anyone else, and I wanted to say lsh truthfully, but finally didn't. Then we just lay there for a while. Then we just lay there for a while and were called up to set off to a place (I forget).",
"I dreamed of asking my professor for a recommendation letter on the eve of my application. Jay seemed to be very positive, so I thought this letter of recommendation should be well written. Then it seems that I had an exchange with Jamil. I woke up and thought about it, but there was nothing Jay could write for me. I still need to keep working hard.",
"Trying to take a bus in New York, or a strange city, finding an open-air bus, going to the upper level, the sky raining, sitting for a short time, crossing a viaduct to my destination, only to have the conductor say it was $13. I thought I didn't have any money so I asked her if she had a venmo, and she reluctantly pulled out her cell phone. That's when he saw a large wad of bills in the compartment of my wallet, which I had stuffed in there in one go earlier, only I had forgotten about it. So he paid with that money.
The destination was a restaurant. I went in and felt quite fancy, did not sit down to eat and left.
The next scene came to Portland, went to the hotel check in, the first night is not bad, but the second night was told to change the room, the room number is 128, looking around but also did not find. It turns out that the hotel management chaos, room number all be reassigned. When I opened the door to the room, I found that there was only one bed inside, which was also very dilapidated. I don't know when I broke my right index finger, but I didn't feel much pain, so I put it on myself and kept it still, waiting for the wound to heal. Although the movement was a bit limited at first, it slowly returned to normal. I felt relieved. After that, my friends and I came to a room (and one of the girls some ambiguity), I gave them popular psychological knowledge, about rational and emotional [the night before and lhy watched the wandering earth, and he discussed the problem], with the help of Kahneman's dual processing theory explained a little.
The next scene came to scan lab. Jamil and Matt came here for a visit at some point, and Matt and I collaborated on a project. I can't remember the details.",
"I had a dream within a dream: I dreamt that I dreamt that I got a huge check and a package from a person, a total of more than one million one hundred thousand to give to Hongzizhe, so I came to a gym [I have had several dreams about gyms before, one was playing table tennis in a place like the NPC Century Hall in Beijing; a couple of other times was playing basketball; a couple of other times was in a gym with anaerobic training. One was in the basement, connected to Washington Square Park, one was in a glass house; another was in a very fancy circular hall, climbing the steps to the upper floor was the training area, I experienced a yoga class] I saw Hongzizhe next to a bench press machine, and was about to wrap it for him when I woke up from the second level dream. So I started to record this part (in the first level dream).
The gym scene reminded me of a previous dream where I was in a mall like CapitaMall, with three floors in total. I took the elevator to the upper floor and found many people lined up to buy food. Climbing from the ladder to the roof, I found the area around the mall very empty. After a while, it seemed that an enemy started to chase us, so we rushed to hide in the house] I can't remember the exact details.
After that, something happened, I can not remember, I came to a circular device, it seems to need to find the mouth from the middle to climb up, so a few simple operations to find a mouth that just allows my body to pass through [similar confined spaces and passages have been dreamed of several times, such as the basement a passage leading to the treasure chest]. The next scene was in 1802, I turned out a pair of sneakers from the cupboard, thinking it was the once lost one bought in the UK Crow's assassin, and then took a look at the sole is not carbon fiber, so it is not, so some disappointment. Then I saw a lot of clothes and shoes, some were worn as a child, some were prizes won by participating in a Columbia University competition, with the name of Columbia University printed on them [the previous day in the lab to organize the varsity team's information, everyone had a Columbia University shirt on them]. ",
"I dreamed that I talked to Kevin, and he asked about whether there was any confirmation about Monday's subject, and I found out that there was none yet, and I was a little anxious that it would be too late to cancel [in reality, a subject's slot should be cancelled the next morning]. After that, I dreamed that I was back in elementary/junior high school, playing on the basketball court of Cuivi Elementary School [this scene was also seen in my dream several times]. After that, someone brought barbecue meat, and we all ate together. [About playing ball: A few times I was in a place similar to NPC or NPC Central School, with a few street courts, playing ball with others, and then walking home together through Renmin University. In the dream, Renmin University and the surrounding environment seemed to be mixed with the Cuiwei Road (Yuyuantan South Road) side. There was another time when I was near the NPC Central School, and I went to buy food outside the school after playing, and crossed what looked like Haidian South Road and waited for a car by the roadside].
When it comes to stadiums and gymnasiums, I remember once dreaming of going to a Real Madrid (or other team) soccer game and climbing for a long time to get to the top of the stadium. Dad a go, in the middle of several times lost, can not find a seat].",
"I dreamed that in 1802, I found an injured white pigeon with my mother, as if it had been bitten by a cat. Thought it was dead, but found it was still alive and tried to find if there was still a pet store open, however it was already 10pm. I was very anxious. Then the pigeon's condition gradually improved, I fed it food, and it ended up biting my right hand with its mouth, which hurt, so I used the food in my left hand to attract it to let go of my right hand [the night before I watched a video on attracting kittens and puppies with food].",
"I have a smart bracelet that allows for instant movement. It is used when a hologram is presented, projected in front of me, and I step inside to move to another place. This day I went to the gym, did a few bench presses, and then tried to rush back to a place or something, but the instantaneous movement was broken. So I had to use my smart bracelet to call uber. after I called it, I ran all the way to the car and another friend had been waiting inside for a while. The scene of this story is in New York, yet the streets and neighborhoods I crossed while running from the gym to the uber were very much like my hometown Tangshan, or the town that appeared in my previous dreams.
Back home / or hotel, Mr. Tang and I and others decided to go swimming, so we started to stuff things into the north bag, however there were a lot of things, thinking that it must be heavy to carry [had many dreams of organizing things, one of them was in London: before leaving to organize the room, the room layout seemed to be a small bedroom of 909. However, there are too many things, and do not want to throw away, so very anxious]",
"In a conference hall, I was approached by a professor who wanted to talk to me. I went over to Dan Gilbert and talked to him about my understanding of moral psycology (which I had talked to Chelsea Helion about during the scan the day before). However, he didn't seem very impressed and questioned some of my points. Then I left unhappily and went to the ball at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. I looked up at the huge SAT-like hall with beautiful baroque decorations on the dome and thought to myself that this building was only four stories high, but it was actually like ten stories of a typical house. Then the ball started and I didn't have a ticket so I went back home to 1802. Xuan Xuan and Mr. Tang were also there, and they both had tickets. This is when everyone started to change into formal wear, while I was eating on the side and not planning to go. Then XuanXuan's grandma/grandmother came knocking on the door and asked if I wanted to join them, I pushed back a bit but ended up arriving with them. Since I didn't have a ticket, I didn't have a lunch voucher, so I had to watch them both eat.",
"He Yuesen held a rdfz class reunion to celebrate Liu Yige's birthday (I thought to myself, He Yuesen still knows her.) Harry and others were there, and they asked me if I wanted to join them, and I thought about it and said yes. Then we went to a movie theater and started to show the movie (I can't remember the plot). I dreamed of many similar theater scenes: once in a lecture hall modeled after the NPCA classroom, with so many people that I seemed to have forgotten to turn in my homework; once in a movie theater (the scene was like the junction of Broadway and Lafayette), where I arrived late and sat down in a seat on the side with not many people inside; and once in a very large theater I found a seat in the middle and back of the theater and later came out of the theater and drove/taxied somewhere under the shroud of night, with abandoned houses and poles lining the road, like a small town on an American highway].
Another scene was on a beach, and from the far sky a meteorite (or maybe it was a plane) fell and the sea went up in flames.
I was sitting in the back seat of a car with a kid about 12 or 13 years old, and he showed me a website that he often goes to, which has some pornographic content on it, and I felt a little embarrassed.
The last scene was in the bedroom of 1802, and I told Chelsea Helion some of my thoughts about psychology, but she didn't seem to agree.",
"Went to see a movie starring an older man with a name like an nba star, the movie was about him being unappreciated to taking his school's hockey team to the championship. Later the uncle came to reality, after getting to know him and found out he was the bad guy, raised his gun and forced us to jump from a manhole cover on a bridge and left our belongings. However, it was later discovered that he was actually protecting us - because there was a group of people chasing us, he left our things so the group stopped chasing.
Another scene was skiing, but I can't remember the details.
There was also a scene at the beach that I had dreamed about before. The location was Hainan, and it was only a two-minute walk from the family's house to the public beach. I asked my mother if the house on the hillside not far away was more expensive because the location was better, and she said yes.",
"I had a dream about going to Portland for spsp [in reality, I had just been there a few weeks ago] and I suddenly found myself presenting my undergrad thesis work a few hours ago, and I was very anxious because I hadn't started the PowerPoint yet. At this point, I saw that Annie was going to present her work, and I was very excited because it was very relevant to my research. However, after she started, I realized that Jon Freeman was not among the mentors she listed above, and her work was not the research I thought it was (although, her page of slides inspired me to take a macro perspective on the issues related to prejudice). After her talk, I was happy to go up and say hello, only to find out that she didn't know me. It turned out that she was Annie DePiere and not Annie Hill.
After that, I interacted with Molly and Kevin, but I don't remember the details.
When I finally came out of the venue, I ran in the light rain in Portland, thinking I really liked the city, but I ran and ran to the canal street [some scenes like the broadway and soho that had appeared in my previous dreams].
Finally, I also dreamed that I came to the second floor of a small loft with some handicrafts inside. Wang Mingxiao and I wanted to buy a lottery ticket (? (I can't remember), then I spoke some Spanish, Wang Mingxiao expressed contempt, said I do not know Spanish at all.",
"Had a very long and complicated dream, most of the details can not remember. The last scene was that I needed to rescue a base from a fire caused by a chemical spill - the base was responsible for researching high-tech equipment, and the scope of the fire made the toxic material leak. I got in the helicopter and flew to the fire area at full speed with a few other people. The navigation showed that it would take five minutes to fly, and I thought that I might not be able to make it. When I got to the top of the burning area, I turned on the sprinkler function of the helicopter and started to put out the fire, which went relatively well.",
"After waking up at 8:10, I ignored the alarm clock and went back to sleep, and this time had a dream about going back to middle school. I dreamed I arrived at the entrance of the middle school in a car [the scene actually looked like the streets of a third-tier city, and there were a couple of dreams with similar scenes: once riding a bike in a place that looked like the park next to 1802 (which the dream seemed to think was Hangzhou), and once walking next to the Kunyu River all the way to the inside of the Summer Palace, passing many small dams and waterfalls midway; and a toxic pool]. I changed into Guo Zimu's leggings and shoes [in reality, I saw her post a fitness friend circle the day before] and thought, this shoe is much better than my own, and my legs seem to have become as fit as hers, thinking I really need to get back to working out. When I entered the class, my usual seat was occupied, looked behind me, and I didn't want to make it to the last few rows, so I made it to Yuan Yutao [my deskmate in junior high school] and talked to her a few times. Then Zhu Manling (class president) [elementary school classmates, but I did not realize that this kind of wear the plot] came to the podium and began to organize discipline, I saw a lot of people beside me, on the one hand, very warm, nostalgic for the time of middle school, on the other hand, think about their own months did not cut the hair [in reality has not cut five months], feel a little embarrassed, their image can be better. Then I woke up and saw that it was too late to get up again, so I got up.",
"First scenario: At the mbbi scan, the time was about ten in the morning and I was supposed to meet the subject. However, I was forty-five minutes late because I was doing something (can't remember), and by the time I got out the door, I ran into Sydney Krueger-seeing her about to explode, I told myself it was a dream, and came to the previous level of the dream: I was still getting ready for the scan, but this time I counted the time and got the subject without any problems. After that I had to take the bus from Downtown to Columbia University. However, I didn't get off the bus at 116th street, but remembered that I wasn't going to mbbi, so I tried to get the driver to let me off the bus in the middle of the ride, only to find that the driver had fallen asleep (I was sitting on the driver's right), and seeing that the bus was about to crash into the guardrail, I hurriedly helped the driver hit the wheel. The driver also came to his senses immediately. He opened the door and let me out, but the people on the bus seemed very upset, cursing and urging me to get off. One of them was a direct subway ride from the JFK airport, passing an open-air station in the middle, but it was much larger than the 125 connection, like a customs office. Further on went through a very scenic forest, with a lake on the right hand side, and mountains like Patagonia in the distance].
The next scene was at home, I told the Sony staff that I had just started working at Sony in order to get a discount (although it was all made up), then he asked me for personal information and I gave him my cell phone number. After a while he came knocking on my door and seemed to want to gather further information. I hurriedly hid in the toilet, not daring to make a sound. After he left I went downstairs and saw a strange city with some glass buildings of about ten stories across the street, including Sony's headquarters. I got home and started to shower and saw some blood in my underwear, and when I found out that my jb was broken, I panicked and woke up from my dream.",
"The first scenario was in Beijing and decided to take a tennis lesson from Coach Sun. However, the location was a suburban golf base with good greenery but too far away. It would take nearly two hours to get there by public transportation. I thought my parents could drive me there and it would only take about 40 minutes. When I got there, I found Coach Sun playing with a female student and said she was very talented, just like Zhang Yi many years ago. I was happy in my heart, but felt some regret because I did not stick to the practice.
I woke up and fell asleep again and entered the second scene in a room with a man have sex. at first from behind, then switched to oral. it seemed to be going on in correspondence to what was in the video. My jb got a lot bigger, but I didn't feel very aroused.",
"We participated in Sound of Silence with our friends (Mr. Tang, Professor Lu, XuanXuan and others) and sang sound of silence, which was said by the judges to be the best performance among our three songs. Afterwards, we went backstage to have a buffet dinner. Wang Yue was also there, and we talked about some emotion-related topics. She asked me if I had ever fallen in love with my friend's girlfriend, so I laughed and she laughed too.
After that, I took the train from the competition place back to my home in upper west. I was carrying a suitcase, but when I changed trains, I found that I had left my suitcase on the train, and the train I changed on was still the wrong one, and I didn't know where it was going. I was very anxious.
Next scene: I ran into a star and his assistant on a rainy day in Beijing [the day before I just watched the Chinatown Detective starring Liu Haoran, and the star looked like he missed him] I asked them if they were going in the direction of rdfz, and if they could take me home, and they agreed.

"I dreamed I was back in high school class, I couldn't keep up with the teacher's math because I missed too much class (probably because I came to the US to go to college), and I heard I was going to take a test soon and was very anxious [I've had many similar dreams, mostly when I'm about to take a test and find that I haven't done the test content and exercises, and also when I've had a lesson in the labor class but haven't started doing my last assignment]. In the middle of the teacher decided to let everyone show their test papers, I thought of a way to put two chairs in the middle of the podium in front of the classroom, and placed a cardboard full of test papers on it, and finally stabilized it after a while [that afternoon I saw other people using a similar method to talk about moving cabinets out of the original lab - because the lab will be renovated soon].

The next scene in a monument valley like the castle, my friend and I and a group of people to phone a series of things to complete the task. Eventually, when some series of props were collected we pulled the switch together and dozens of faucets around the circular platform we were on started spewing fire. The original platform is a primitive spaceship, by spraying fire to push us off the ground. [Think of a dream of going into space as an astronaut, and a floating in space] The operator of the platform was a woman, who seemed to make some mistakes at first, causing the ship to almost flip over completely, although we did not feel the weightlessness.

He asked me who I was going to apply to and I said Molly, Mina, and Darrel Cameron. he didn't seem to have heard of the third person, so I repeated the name.

When it was time for lunch, a group of us brought the rice we had weighed in the morning and prepared to heat it up.

I also thought about changing to another cheaper Japanese restaurant, which often occurs in my dreams - the space is small, the customers are sitting at the two sides of the counter, and the fried chicken rice seems to be better. There were also a few times in the narrow hutongs of Beijing].
I went back to my high school class and wrote an essay, but I can't remember the details. I was a little surprised to find out that Hu Jiang Yue and Harry were together on Instagram - I thought they knew each other [and mistakenly thought Hu Jiang Yue was from the International Section of NPCA]. Tong Hui said, recently we talked quite a lot, good.
Later, I attended an event, like in a movie, and met some survivors of the Nazi Holocaust. In a place like a nursing home, there was a lady whose family sent her some items, and the atmosphere was very sad, and I cried.
The last scene I remember was on the subway, there were some professors sitting across from each other, Molly, Mina and the female version of Darrel Cameron, all seemed very friendly and strengthened my determination to apply to their lab. I think it's normal that they didn't come this time because it' s so far away in Jamil.",
"Came to Whistler to ski, but took a bus to talk about the streets of New York all the way up (the snowy mountain was not far away). My friend got off the bus halfway through and planned to start skiing on a slower slope, while I planned to get to the top of the mountain. I was excited on the way, but when I got to the top I decided I needed to buy skis first, and after picking and choosing I finally seemed to pick a pair, and then saw that there were nio Azure cars being sold on Amazon for about $16,000, and they were already booked for three rounds of production later.
The first time I saw a nio Azure, I saw that it was being sold on Amazon for about $60,000. I was skiing very fast and was a little worried about falling into the cliff in front of me. There were also a couple of trips to Colorado or Whistler's dream, once in an amusement park-like scene, seemingly with Tong Hui, and another time in a snow store trying to find the right equipment].",
"Visiting the rooftop of an apartment in New York, with Liu Hao Yang and others. I point to Eugene's rooftop not far away, which seems to be the highest observation deck in New York.
The next scene (and possibly the last one) I visited a city (not sure if it was domestic or foreign) and stayed in a small hotel [had many dreams about staying in a hotel, a few times in very cramped rooms with no light and no air circulation, in reality probably with my head covered in the blanket]. I wandered around the streets and ate at the street-side restaurant below the hotel, which seemed to be a Chinese roadside snack.
The next scene was a meeting with Kevin, before the meeting he texted me a template for a performance evaluation form, based on what an old professor had used, and I thought it would be good.",
"I dreamed that I went with a friend to get a tattoo, in a Hunan and a little shabby store, generally before the tattoo to give anesthesia to the arm, I see the environment is a little poor, some worry about the pillow is not clean, but still played. However, my right arm is not completely anesthetized (may in reality be pressed into the numbness), while the left arm is not anesthetized at all. Tattoo big brother (a bit of a fierce one) said you can use the laser directly, but I was a bit afraid of pain, so I said no tattoo. Brother seemed very angry, said I had to come back at a later date, I perfunctorily said yes.
The next scene was in a square where it was raining heavily and the sun was pouring down from the clouds, lighting up the whole square in golden color. I seemed to be waiting for someone, or completing a task, half asleep and repeating some operation, but couldn't remember.",
"Basketball court; hang out with friends, finish up programming assignment on laptop (sort of anxious); going to an exhibition with a girl, thinking she might be into me.
A huge exhibition hall, people playing quartet in the middle; I said it was Schubert but it was in fact Mendelssohn. During lunch hour much fewer people around.
Next scene was Harry and I in Beijing, we killed a person who we argued with and cut open his face to destroy the evidence. There were people walking past but they did not seem to pay attention. I took the dead’s cell phone with me, lest the police was able to identify him through the phone. I decided to throw away the phone at some distant trash bin. Harry and I boarded a bus, not sure where it’s heading (since I did not recognize the stop names). Then I woke up.",
"I dreamed of traveling to the Arctic Circle. I was accompanied by my mother, Tong Hui and his girlfriend. However, Tong Hui couldn't come temporarily, so I thought his girlfriend wouldn't come either, but I finally met her at the North Pole. At first we stayed at the hotel, and I went out alone to explore the surrounding area, and saw that it was well built, with a few basketball courts under a bridge, and a few people playing ball [the scene was somewhat like the court under the riverside drive; I would occasionally pass by before coming home]. I went back to the hotel and observed my room, and found a total of three beds, two on the first floor and one upstairs, but in the same large space as the bed below, which was a bit worn. My mom and I headed to a tourist attraction where there were a lot of people and there was a helicopter tour and what looked like scuba diving. My mom and I discussed whether to sign up. At this point it seemed that the program manager there started to hunt me down and no matter what I did, I would end up being ""killed"" by her and then started from scratch, seemingly in a game that I tried to resist in the middle, but not very successfully. Finally I found Harry (who had traveled to the North Pole before). Together with him, I tried to resist the managers. I can't remember the details after that.",
"When I attended the graduation ceremony of RDFZ, I saw that Tong Hui was interviewed on the Spring Festival, and I felt admiration for him.",
"I dreamed of attending an event (study?) with Prof. Lu. In the middle of the event, I talked about my future plans, and Prof. Lu kept questioning me if I really wanted to do research, and if not, I should not lie to myself and should go and make a decisive choice. I was a little anxious after listening to it.",
"What I remember are mostly clips. One of the scenes was on an Asian food street [somewhat similar to the one that appeared before]. I was planning to go to dinner with Mr. Tang and others, but I felt a little bloated, plus I wanted to be alone for some reason that day, so I didn't go with them. I was a little envious when I heard later that they had gone to a fish hotpot.",
"The first scene of the dream was from the perspective of a robber [just watched an episode of Detective Conan about robbers the night before (Ripple's Magician)] and an accomplice to attack a building. We released the gas on the second floor to the first floor lobby, then my accomplice decided to go downstairs to continue the robbery, but I was afraid that the police would come after me, so I ran to the roof of the building rooftop, after going up I tried to mix into the tourists on the rooftop, however, or sad a police officer recognized, see him coming towards me, I ran towards the edge of the rooftop, and finally leapt and smashed into a car on the ground. This is the scene cut back to myself, I passed by the block, and saw that this fallen fugitive did not fall to his death, but badly broken bones can not move. And his other accomplice was also killed by the police during the attack downstairs.
One of the scenes after that was taking a shower at home, the corner of the bathroom was dirty and I felt a little uncomfortable.
The scene after that is really a street in Beijing, my family's car was stopped by the traffic police, the traffic police began to investigate my father's income status [the day before I saw the news that James Harden was fined by the traffic police for riding an electric bike in Shanghai].
The scene after that was back in the high school classroom, I sat in the last seat of the rightmost row of the classroom, after that came to a van, encountered a problem (do not remember exactly what it was), and then the Chinese and Americans in the car gave the solution respectively - the Chinese decided to take turns to monitor the progress of the plan and put a lot of manpower and resources, while the Americans decided to use an extremely energy-consuming technology to (?) to keep the car warm.",
"I dreamed of buying an electric piano [similar dream done a few times before, once when the piano broke down and was played at 1802]. Someone else asked me how much it cost, and I didn't have the heart to say $1300, because I felt my level was not worthy of that price. However, he (it seems to be DeHo) then asked, is there 800, I was a little embarrassed and had to say, almost.
The scene after that seemed to be a car ride somewhere, with the family, and it seems there was Wukezheng, but I can't remember the details.",
"I dreamed that I was traveling to Norway/Iceland with my classmates and before I was about to leave for the airport, my friend who was passing asked me if I had a visa. I said I had done a Norwegian visa before, but not for Ireland. When I got there I was a little disappointed once I saw the aurora borealis and seemed to see a green light appearing in the sky, but wasn't sure if it was a reflection effect from the glass or the real aurora borealis, and later found out that it seemed to be an illusion.
After the scene came to the universe, I looked at the rapid movement of other planets from the perspective of a planet, I observed their trajectory and felt very shocked. I had similar dreams of exploring in the universe before, once as an astronaut entering near-Earth orbit and going out of the warehouse to investigate, but then seemed to fly back to the surface; and once exploring between planets, seemingly in a computer game, fighting with enemies]",
"I dreamed that I was in New York, late and still awake, a gala was being held on the street, I rode the citibike out for a stroll and bought several boxes of candles, both large and small, and I went back to my apartment thinking they would probably make the room air smell nice, after which I looked at my watch and found it was after one o'clock, so I hurriedly got ready for bed, after all, I had to go to another NYSPI meeting early the next morning (just like in reality).",
"The dream was divided into two parts, the first was having a female friend over, then she started undressing and then we started having sex (although I knew she had a boyfriend).
The second scene was in high school, where we seemed to be handed over to the building for criticism by the head of the year group for opposing the teacher's arrangement, and I was a little scared but convinced I was right, so I also walked out firmly.",
"The movie seemed to be more than three hours, I had already watched it that morning for some reason, but there was a section in the middle that I hadn't seen, so this time I purposely went out with Li Hao Yu with the intention of making up for it, after watching half of it, I wanted to go to the bathroom, so I went out first, but stayed outside for a little longer, so when I came back the movie had already passed a big part.
The next scene was in the big playground of RDFZ, I was recording a video with a classmate across the street (can't remember who) while Raissa was standing next to him, the video had him asking her a question, but can't remember.
Before I finally woke up, I dreamed that the subject who had called earlier to provide information about the IMPLANT called again and asked about scheduling, I heard her voice seemed a bit impatient (in reality, she should be a very nice person) and told her that someone was already arranging it.",
